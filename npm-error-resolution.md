# ESLint Dependency Conflict Resolution

## Problem

You encountered the following error:
```
npm ERR! code EOVERRIDE
npm ERR! Override for eslint@^9.21.0 conflicts with direct dependency
```

## Solution

The issue occurs because there's a conflict between ESLint versions in your dependencies. This has been fixed by:

1. Updating the direct ESLint dependency to version 8.57.0
2. Adding a "resolutions" field to ensure consistent ESLint version usage across all dependencies
3. Removing any conflicting overrides

## Installation Steps

Run one of the following commands based on your package manager:

### For pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### For npm:

```bash
npm install
```

This should now work without the EOVERRIDE error.

## Note

If you still encounter issues, you may want to try clearing your package manager cache:

```bash
pnpm store prune
# or
npm cache clean --force
```

Then try installing again.
